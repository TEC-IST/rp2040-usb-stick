# rp2040-usb-stick

This is a small RP2040-based stick for direct insertion into a USB-A port, for use as PC GPIO, oscilloscope, custom interfaces, data logging, a mouse jiggler, etc.

The PCB exposes 4 x ADC and 6 x GPIO via small pads on the back of the PCB.  Other GPIO are accessible as pad leadouts from the RP2040, although soldering to these will require some skill due to their narrow pitch.

Only 1.6mm PCB thickness is economical at JLCPCB, so the assembled PCB will need a shim on the portion that is inserted into the USB-A port to fit securely in place.

Effective 2023 April 12: PCBs are currently on order -- once available software will be uploaded to this repo.
